The BMW 6 Series is a series of luxury grand tourers produced by the German automaker BMW.

The first was the E24, being derived from the first generation 7 Series, the BMW E23. The E24 was launched in 1976 to replace the 3.0CS & 3.0CSi (E9). In 2003, 14 years after production ceased, BMW released the all new E63/E64, which was available as a coupé and convertible, based on the chassis of the E60 5 Series sedan.
